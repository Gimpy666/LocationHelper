# LocationHelper by Gimpy666

This script will tell you the coordinate that your player is currently on
and it will also allow you to specify which tile to highlight on the main
screen while the script is running so you can test multiple coordinates /
tiles without restarting or modifying the script

# Tested with:
- RuneLite x64
- Simba r1400 x64
- SRL-T 7.20.3
- WaspLib 20.2.3

# Instructions:
- Change the REGION const variable to the chunks that you will be using
  this script for
- When running the script, in the chat text box, type in a message and
  the simba console will write text like "my message : [5588,29710]"
  which will show your players coordinates every 2 - 3 seconds
- If you want to highlight a tile on the screen, type in a coordiante
  in the chat text box like X,Y or 123,456 and then click the clan chat
  tab to tell the script that you want to highlight that tile
